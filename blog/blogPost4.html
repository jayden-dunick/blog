                <p>With this being the first summative of year 2 I believe I did quite well, I didn't meet any big roadblocks, for the most part, I just had to remember what I learnt before this and reevaluate it with new things. For example, using semantic code more instead of divs, or naming with camel case. Both new things to me but I think I've been able to integrate them well throughout the 4 weeks. 
<br><br>
With each summative, I believe I find moments where I coast on my knowledge instead of pushing myself and learning more. So each time find ways that I can either limit myself or express myself in different ways. This time I wasn't able to do that so well though, having to jump into code again I did more experimentation outside of class to help broaden my understanding and I want to do that more as I found it quite entertaining. 
<br><br>
I believe what let me down, in this case, was my design. I do still really like the concept but I could've layered the values and design throughout more. For example, adding more individuality on the contact page, it did the job, yes but it also didn't do anything new or help express my brand. 
<br><br>
Giving it thought I did miss the two days which might've messed with my flow. Doing that helped me find that I don't like working at home, too many distractions and I find it harder to enter a mindset where I can work from. I know that I was sick but I could've attempted to block out those distractions and push through the block.
<br><br>
What went well and I enjoyed was experimenting with what I had learnt and applied it in new ways. Seeing that and attempting to channel that enjoyment into new things I believe will aid greatly with my work ethic. Apart from that setting and following a set schedual will allow me to keep track of work and give me a better idea of progress documenting each step.
<br><br>
I would attempt to manage my time better, seeing what things are a detriment to my progress and blocking them out. But also trying to channel that experimenting mindset to new avenues as in the past that's helped me a lot with learning photoshop and photography for example./p>
