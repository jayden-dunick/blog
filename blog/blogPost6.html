                <h3>Field Review</h3><br>
                <p>The topic I chose this time around was related to was cars, specifically off-road racing. A topic I’ve not really delved into before when doing design. With what I wanted to present with this time around was something more bold and competitive. While the competition was apart of my brand last summative I feel it could’ve been further implemented throughout, and so with this, I felt I could go with something that has a larger focus on competition hence a race. 
<br><br>
First up is a website I found on awwwards Cars &amp; Coffee, a website showcasing somewhat a similar vein to what I want to present. Just it’s more of an event to celebrate automobiles and share it with the world, looking to appeal to the collectors, admirers and dreamers they present this event across the world. Opening the page I straight away see “Live your passion everywhere” upon a blank background but it soon reveals a photo of a supercar in the background which helps guide the user into the hierarchy, enticed with the scroll call to action at the bottom I do just that and find the navbar state change to be quite appealing and smooth, continuing that movement you scroll past a grid of events, an about section and then a channel/news update space. With how skewed the text is with 2 paragraphs having about a ⅙ of the content the other 2 have it’s not too appealing and just draws too much attention. At the end of the page, they call to starting your own event which if the user was sold of the idea they’d probably click it. Looking through the rest of the website they keep it a little more contained, within the starting your own event section they include more graphical elements and use some quite nice dialogue boxes for inputting text. Finally, their navigation with how they’ve implemented the easing on the transition is really appealing.  
<br><br>
Looking through the site now I would say it’s well designed and keeps in mind the user. Their colours are more muted in general too to what I was thinking of creating, using a lot of black and white and scattering a dark red throughout for focal points.  There are a few hiccups of course but overall I did find it quite pleasant to browse. While targeting a bit more of a different crowd to what I am I still believe it’s quite relevant to what I want to create, looking to how they’ve portrayed their subject of cars and content can help provide a basis for my own ideas and how I can spin my more action-oriented topic to it more. 
<br><br>
Second to the plate is Cowboy,  a product-focused site. Upon opening taking the opposite approach to Cars &amp; Coffee, showcasing the image first but adding a bit of flair to it with headings fading in and moving towards the bike and then a subheading appearing under on the right. With that, it’s stood out and made me partially sold on the product from the web experience alone. Starting to scroll the navbar has a little transition with the logo just one thing is the red and black words blend with the large headers from before upon scroll. Continuing you reach a section with an animation loop of the bike, explaining how the bike will fare in different conditions after that is a slightly jarring lock screen but with that as you scroll more the background fades to black showcasing the headlights of the bike. From there it shows the battery and a small demonstration of its components that also changes upon scrolling, how the bike interacts with an app while the phone locks scroll position as you scroll. Finally, you hit the specifications and a call to action asking to buy the bike showcasing it in a similar way as to when you opened the page. As if it were finishing how it started. 
<br><br>
Even if I’m not much of a bike rider the slight bits of interaction were memorable as if they were selling me the product without me laying my eyes upon it. Especially after going from some quite static websites, this seems like it’s new and from that stands out to me. While I’ve heard that everything leading up to the product is used to sell it including the unboxing but this website to me reiterates that point and inspires me to push the boundaries with what you can do with a website giving the user something memorable. 
<br><br>
Finally, there’s Viita Watches an analog watch themed around motorsports and so another product but is a racing focused one. Right out the gate, you see the logo shown in an animation. Elements of the page come in one after another after that. With large typography on the left, product in the middle and on the right is photography. When scrolling the page reveals to be a side scroller, and you get a taste for the general idea this page follows. Showing the product, a racing video/photo, and text all presented within differing grid presentations. Some elements animate in and some elements like text or backgrounds have subtle animations when idling or scrolling. With its typography on each headline’s first character, they stretch it out. Reaching the end of the page you see a checkered flag span the height of the screen signalling the finish. From there is a link to buying the watch, with that site seeming a little lacking in comparison. Repeating the same fade-in transition upon scroll with all the images. I can’t find any pattern with how they arranged the text they look to have placed it randomly on each side so people may not find it too easy to follow in a Z movement. Ending it with an email dialogue box. 
<br><br>
I do quite like this page but I can also see that there’s a lot going on that the viewer may be overwhelmed or not as enticed to buy the product as you would feel after viewing Cowboy. Something of note though to me is the colours, how all the photos are either B&amp;W or feature a large yellow presence. Keeping all other elements on the page to follow that black, white and yellow. While the animations are appealing they can overshadow the product though as I said before. In Cowboy, they treated the page as a product demo using the browser to advertise and provide the viewer with an idea of the product with just seeing the site. Viita is still nice I’d say but I’m nowhere near as enticed to get the product with its experience. 

With these 3, they all had their ways of presenting either their product or event. Some even implementing the features of the product as apart of the browser. This helped reiterate the point that experience can be very important as it can sell a product without seeing it in person. Or that going for that extra mile when keeping in mind the user can create something more memorable. I do believe these can help me when creating my own site and I’ll be looking to ways to implement the browser as a method to advertise in the future too.
