                <h4>User Test</h4>
                <p>From the original user tests that I preformed with my paper prototypes, I got a variety of feedback. To this them there was things like; increase the content divider sizes, to mix the what I had as an article list to become home and make what I had orginally as my landing page to become my about page. That was due in part to the content suiting those pages more and that with things like the about page they seemed to be a little generic and didn't play too well to my brand so I changed it in efforts to give it a little more personality. Other than that there were to make the social media icons smaller and that the tags should be horizontal with the author in my articles. </p>

                <h3>Sketch</h3>
                <br>
                <h4>Lo-Fi</h4>
                <br>
                <embed src="images/lo-Fi.pdf" width="650px" height="600px" type="application/pdf">
                <a href="images/lo-Fi.pdf">Link to the Lo-Fi pdf</a><br><br>
                <p>In this process I began to look into more news websites and found that the home/article page would have the current headlines but as you scrolled down the page you'd find they were in more a list so in efforts to do that I modified it a in efforts to one make it more consistant across the site and two to make it more like other sites so the user may feel more comfortable with it.

                    <br><br>Apart from that I was at the state where I could throw in both images and text. I'm quite happy with the current design and will maybe only need to adjust a few different sizes accordingly to what image I want and to improve the hierarchy.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>Hi-Fi</h4>
                <br>
                <embed src="images/hi-Fi.pdf" width="650px" height="600px" type="application/pdf">
                <a href="images/hi-Fi.pdf">Link to the Hi-Fi pdf</a>
                <br><br>
                <p>Since going from the Lo-Fi not too much has changed, for the most part it's been me adding images and text. At Simon's suggestion I removed the button background in efforts to raise the age range and help target an older audience/not take away from the more colourful imagery. Adding the images and text however allowed me to gain a better understanding of the hierarchy letting me adjust the images accordingly to the text and vice versa.
                <br><br>
                Adding the footer was in efforts to give me something to end the scroll on and provide a place for the social media links as in the contact page they were too large and didn't suit the grid drawing too much attention now matter how I placed them. But speaking of scrolling preforming that test where you set a custom size and enter the preview mode helped further in changing the hierarchy in the titles to the paragraphs, as originally it was weighed heavily in the headings while the paragraphs were too small to read them effectivly and not be confused.

                <h4>Hi-Fi User test</h4>
                <br>
                <p>Overall feedback was quite positive, critiques that were had were things like the content divider could be made a little smaller, give the footer a little more room and to decrease the author and tag size to improve hierarchy further.</p>
